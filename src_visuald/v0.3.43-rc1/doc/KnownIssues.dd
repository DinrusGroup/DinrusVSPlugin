$(P
Please consult the ticket view for issues within Visual D. Some irritating behaveour is not
caused by Visual D - these are listed here:)

$(H2 Visual Studio Express)

$(P Visual D does not work with any of the Express version of Visual Studio. These editions do not
support loading third party extensions and add-ins.)

$(P A free alternative are the integrated Visual Studio Shell distributions.
The shells are identical with the Visual Studio IDE, but stripped of any language support. It
still contains the native debugger that can be used to debug D applications. Please see the
$(LINK2 installation.html, installation page) for download links.)

$(P Unfortunately, the Visual Studio Shell is missing one file, that is needed for the conversion of 
the debug information by cv2pdb. This is msobj80.dll for VS2008 and msobj100.dll for VS2010 and must 
be extracted from a standard installation, the Visual C Express edition or the Windows SDK. You might
also find it installed by other Microsoft products.)

$(P In November 2014 Microsoft released $(B $(LINK2 http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx,
Visual Studio Community 2013)), a version similar to Visual Studio Professional, but free for most users unless 
working in larger companies. Visual D integrates just as well as with the commercial versions.)

$(H2 No parameter tool tips when running alongside Visual Assist)

$(P Visual Assist is an extension to Visual Studio that adds a lot of editing functionality 
to most languages supported by VS, but not D. Unfortunately it interferes with Visual D. A 
known effect is that parameter info tool tips don't work in Visual D while Visual Assist is
active in VS2005 or VS2008 (reported to not happen in VS2010). There are several work-arounds for this:)
$(UL
  $(LI disable Visual Assist while programming in D)
  $(LI assign your favorite keyboard shortcut to the command "VisualD.!ParameterInfo".)
  $(LI add the following Visual Studio macro
   $(PRE
    Sub ParameterInfo()
        If Not ActiveDocument Is Nothing Then
            If ActiveDocument.Language = "D" Then
                DTE.ExecuteCommand("VisualD.ParameterInfo")
            Else
                DTE.ExecuteCommand("Edit.ParameterInfo")
            End If
        End If
    End Sub
   )
   and assign the standard !ParameterInfo shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-Space) to this function.
  )
)


$(H2 Process MsMpEng.exe eats a lot of CPU )

$(P The process MsMpEng.exe is part of the Windows Defender anti virus protection system. 
It seems that it monitors inter-process communication, if it is configured to "real-time protect"
your system, but doing so takes noticeable CPU performance. If Visual D is configured to parse 
or semantically analyze the source code, it delegates this to a separate process vdserver.exe.
This requires considerable data transfer between processes.)

$(P As a result, Windows Defender can harm performance of Visual D. To avoid this,
add the Visual Studio process devenv.exe to the list of Excluded Processes in the 
settings of Windows Defender.)

$(H2 Import libraries from C/C++ projects )

$(P A Visual C/C++ DLL project reports two outputs to dependent projects: the DLL and the import library.)

$(P Unfortunately, the import library reported still contains unexpanded macros and the current working directory prepended 
instead of the project directory. The actual replacements are not accessible to Visual D, so it assumes the
the import library to be placed along-side the DLL.)

$(P If the C++ DLL project is converted to a static library project, the import library setting is kept, though 
unaccessible from the configuration page. The import library is falsely reported as an output. To mitigate
this problem, Visual D ignores the import library if the main output is also a library.)
