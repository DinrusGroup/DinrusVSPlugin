  - VS 2008
  - VS 2010
  - VS 2012
  - VS 2013
  - VS 2015
  
  Unfortunately, Express versions of Visual Studio do not support this 
  kind of extensions. Use the Visual Studio Shell instead:
  - VS 2008 Shell: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9771
  - VS 2010 Shell: no longer available
  - VS 2012 Shell: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30670
                 + http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30663
  
  Starting with VS 2013, Microsoft also released Community Versions of
  Visual Studio, which are free for most users and are similar to the
  professional editions.
  
* Includes tools to
  - convert some idl/h files of the Windows SDK to D
  - convert all idl/h files from the Visual Studio Integration SDK to D
  - convert C++ code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    the DMD front end to D, but this was abandoned)
  - convert Java code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    parts of the Eclipse plugin Descent to D, but this was abandoned)
  
* Completely written in D2

Building Visual D
-----------------
In a nutshell:

- install the Visual Studio SDK
- start Visual Studio and load solution visuald_vs9.sln (VS 2008) or
  visuald_vs10.sln (VS 2010+)
- build project "build"
- build project "VisualD"

Installation
------------

The click-through-installer will guide you through the installation process. 
The installer lets you select the Visual Studio Version for which you want 
Visual D to be installed. It will always install for all users, not only for 
a single user.

To compile your application, you must have DMD installed.

For debugging applications, you should also install cv2pdb which is now 
included in the Visual D installer. Please make sure, changes to 
Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat do not mix with previous manual 
installations of cv2pdb. 

Unfortunately, if you are using the Visual Studio Shell, it misses one file,
that is needed for the conversion of the debug information by cv2pdb. This 
is msobj80.dll for VS2008 and msobj100.dll for VS2010 and must be extracted 
from a standard installation, the Visual C Express edition or the Windows SDK.
You might also find it installed by other Microsoft products.
